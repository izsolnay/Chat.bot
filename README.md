Basic Chatbot

This basic chatbot was designed simply to get a feel for the basic programming of conversational chatbots and how the call and response method works.

This can also be run from the command prompt after downloading the file Chatbot.py:

    In terminal:
    type python (or python3)
    type import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    type exit()
    type cd PATH TO Chatbot FILE python Chatbot.py (or python3 Chatbot.py)
